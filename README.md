### What's this?
This app finds the song based on the lyrics entered. Apart from that, additional details like-the name of artist(s), album,complete lyrics and more beautiful suggestions from the related artist/album are also popped up !

### How's this built?
Well it's not all APIs, some coding is done apart from that to extract *full lyrics* and song covers.

### What's new?
Well the UI is very comprehensible and the swipe feature in the found song section is a must try !
